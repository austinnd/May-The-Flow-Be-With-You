# Flow Hackathon Submission Log
Challenge: May the Flow Be With You (2025)

- Participant: Austin Delger
- Flow Address: 0x27cafb2f0dbee450

Welcome to my running log of submissions for the Flow May challenge. Each week, I’ll be submitting a prototype or game experience. Stay tuned as the ideas evolve each week.

# Week 1 - n/a



# Week 2 — falling_critters
Theme: Actually Fun Game

For this round, I wanted to go light, fast, and actually fun — so I created falling_critters, a casual browser-based game where various animals drop from the sky, and your job is to click them before they hit the ground.

Each successful click earns you points, but let too many critters fall and... game over. The real fun begins after reaching a certain score — players are redirected to an unexpected website that is fun to explore. Think of it as a little secret reward baked into the game. 🎁🌐

🛠 Tech Highlights
Lightweight frontend with real-time click tracking
Modern style
Randomized critter spawns and motion physics
Easter egg: hidden URL unlock once score threshold is passed

🎯 Key Takeaway
I focused on blending simplicity and surprise — it’s a fast-paced game, easy to get into, but with a payoff that makes you want to come back and share it with friends.



# 🔒 Week 3 — TBA
Theme: Generative Art and Worlds

Still under wraps. It’ll be worth the wait.
